## Worldeeee
(in progress still)
A program that is designed to let a user play wordle. Currently working on functionality for it to play wordle itself

## Explanation of the game
A user gets 6 chances to guess the secret word.
After each guess, the game tells the user which of the letters in their guess are in the answer
and some info about their positions within the word.
A yellow tile represents a guessed letter that is in the answer, but not in the correct position.
A green tile represents a letter that is in the answer in the same position.

If the answer has multiple of the same letter, a guess containing multiple of that same letter will 
show as yellow or green to match the number of appearances in the answer.
